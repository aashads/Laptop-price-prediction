**Laptop Price Prediction**

This repository contains a Laptop Price Prediction project using machine learning techniques to predict the price of laptops based on various features like brand, specifications, and other factors.
Project Overview

In this project, we analyze a dataset containing information on various laptops and their specifications to predict their prices. The goal is to build an accurate machine learning model that can predict laptop prices based on key features such as:

    Brand
    Processor type
    RAM size
    Storage type and capacity
    Display size and resolution
    GPU type
    Operating System

The project is implemented in a Colab Notebook and includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Features

    **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing data, feature engineering, and feature scaling.
    **Model Selection:** We experiment with multiple machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
    **Evaluation:** Models are evaluated based on metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) scores.
